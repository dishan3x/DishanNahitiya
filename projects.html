       <h1> Quantitative analysis on soil cover using Deep learning models </h1>

        •	Train deep neural network model to identify soil cover and classify/predict soil, stubble, and green vegetation of an input image of crop fields.
•	The model helps to perform a quantitative analysis on the soil cover which helps agronomists and scientists to get an understanding of soil cover. 
•	Deploy the trained DCNN model using GitHub. 

<h1>Crop characteristic finder</h1>
•	Kola is an image analysis web tool that helps to identify crop properties by using analyzing RGB layers of each pixel of an input image and live mesonet station data for using algorithms.
